                    <p class="para-content">(interactive services).<br><br>
Where we do provide any interactive service, we will provide clear information to you about the kind of service offered, if it is moderated 
and what form of moderation is used (including whether it is human or technical).<br><br>

We will do our best to assess any possible risks for users (and in particular, for children) from third parties when they use any interactive service 
provided on our site, and we will decide in 3 each case whether it is appropriate to use moderation of the relevant service 
(including what kind of moderation to use) in the light of those risks. However, we are under no obligation to oversee, monitor or moderate any 
interactive service we provide on our site, and we expressly exclude our liability for any loss or damage arising from the use of any interactive 
service by a user in contravention of our content standards, whether the service is moderated or not.<br><br>

The use of any of our interactive services by a minor is subject to the consent of their parent or guardian. We advise parents who permit their children 
to use an interactive service that it is important that they communicate with their children about their safety online, as moderation is not fool proof. 
Minors who are using any interactive service should be made aware of the potential risks to them.<br><br>

Where we do moderate an interactive service, we will normally provide you with a means of contacting the moderator, should a concern or difficulty arise.

                    <p class="para-content">We strive to provide you with choices regarding certain personal data uses, particularly around marketing and advertising.</p>

                    <h3 class="para-heading">Promotional offers from us</h3>
                    <p class="para-content">We may use your Identity, Contact, Technical, Usage and Profile Data to form a view on what we think you may want or need, 
                        or what may be of interest to you. This is how we decide which products, services and offers may be relevant for you (we call this marketing).<br>
                        You will receive marketing communications from us if you have requested information from us or purchased goods or services from us and you have 
                        not opted out of receiving that marketing.
</p>

<h3 class="para-heading">Third-party marketing</h3>
                    <p class="para-content">We will get your express opt-in consent before we share your personal data with any third party for marketing purposes.</p>

                    <h3 class="para-heading">Opting out</h3>
                    <p class="para-content">You can ask us or third parties to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by logging into the website and checking
                         or unchecking relevant boxes to adjust your marketing preferences OR by following the opt-out links on any marketing message sent to you OR by 
                         contacting us at any time.<br><br>

                        Where you opt out of receiving these marketing messages, this will not apply to personal data provided to us as a result of a 
                        product/service purchase, warranty registration, product/service experience or other transactions.</p>

                        <h3 class="para-heading">The right to object to profiling</h3>
                    <p class="para-content">You have the right to object to how your personal data is processed including your right to object to profiling as 
                        outlined in this privacy policy. Although we see profiling as a beneficial service allowing you to have easier and quicker access to products, 
                        services and offers tailored specifically to your interests, we respect that you may not feel the same way and understand if you decided to opt 
                        out.</p>

                    <p class="para-content">We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider 
                        that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as 
                        to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact us.<br> If we need to use your personal data 
                        for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.<br> Please note that we may process
                         your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.
</p>
                    <h3 class="para-heading">Disclosures of your personal data</h3>
                    <p class="para-content">We may share your personal data with the parties set out below for the purposes set out in the table above.

                    <ul class="list-area">
                        <li>Internal Third Parties as set out in the Glossary.</li>

                        <li>Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer or merge parts of our business or our assets. 
                            Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, 
                            then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy policy.</li>
                    </ul>
</p>
<p class="para-content">We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our 
    third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in 
    accordance with our instructions.</p>

    <h3 class="para-heading">International transfers</h3>
                    <p class="para-content">We share your personal data within the Corporation and with suppliers providing goods or services requested by you. 
                        This may involve transferring your data outside the United Arab Emirates.<br>
                        We ensure your personal data is protected by requiring all our Corporation companies to follow the same rules when processing your personal data.
                         These rules are called "binding corporate rules".<br> Many of our suppliers are based outside the UAE so their processing of your personal 
                         data will involve a transfer of data outside the UAE.<br> Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the UAE, we ensure a similar degree 
                         of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:

                            <ul class="list-area">
                        <li>We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data 
                            by the Emirates officials.</li>
                        <li>Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the Emirates officials which give personal data 
                            the same protection it has in UAE.</li>
                    </ul>

</p>
                    <p class="para-content">Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your 
                    personal data out of the UAE.</p>

                    <h3 class="para-heading">Data security</h3>
                    <p class="para-content">We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or 
                        accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, 
                        contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and 
                        they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.<br><br>
                        We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a
                        breach where we are legally required to do so. <br><br>We use encrypted transmission links whenever we can.

We use safeguards such as firewalls, authentication systems, and access control mechanisms to control unauthorised access to systems and data.<br><br>

We regularly review our information collection, storage and processing practices, including physical security measures, to guard against unauthorized 
access to systems.<br><br>

We restrict access to personal information to our employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to process it for us and
 who are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations.<br><br>

If you are aged 13 or under you are not allowed to provide us with your personal data and should not use our website and services.
</p>

<h3 class="para-heading">Data retention</h3>
                    <p class="para-content">We will only retain your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, 
                        including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting requirements. We may retain your personal data 
                        for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship 
                        with you.<br><br>

                        To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, 
                        the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data 
                        and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.
                        By law we have to keep basic information about our customers (including Contact, Identity, Financial and Transaction Data) for six years 
                        after they cease being customers for tax purposes.<br><br>

                        In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see your legal rights below for further information. In some circumstances we will 
                        anonymize your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use 
                        this information indefinitely without further notice to you.
</p>

<h3 class="para-heading">Your legal rights</h3>
                    <p class="para-content">Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data.
                    <ul class="list-area">
                        <li>Request access to your personal data.</li>
                        <li>Request correction of your personal data.</li>
                        <li>Request erasure of your personal data.</li>
                        <li>Object to processing of your personal data.</li>
                        <li>Request restriction of processing your personal data.</li>
                        <li>Request transfer of your personal data</li>
                        <li>Right to withdraw consent.</li>
                    </ul>
</p>
<p class="para-content">If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us.</p>

<h3 class="para-heading">No fee usually required</h3>
                    <p class="para-content">You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may 
                        charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your 
                        request in these circumstances.</p>

                        <h3 class="para-heading">What we may need from you</h3>
                    <p class="para-content">We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access 
                        your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed 
                        to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to 
                        speed up our response.</p>

                        <h3 class="para-heading">Time limit to respond</h3>
                    <p class="para-content">We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it could take us longer than a month if your 
                        request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p>


                        <h3 class="para-heading">LAWFUL BASIS</h3>
                    <p class="para-content">Legitimate Interest means the interest of our business in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you 
                        the best service/product and the best and most secure experience. We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you 
                        (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your 
                        personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise 
                        required or permitted to by law). You can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any potential 
                        impact on you in respect of specific activities by contacting us.<br><br>

                        Performance of Contract means processing your data where it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or to 
                        take steps at your request before entering into such a contract.<br><br>

                        Comply with a legal obligation means processing your personal data where it is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation that
                         we are subject to.
</p>

<h3 class="para-heading">YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS</h3>
                    <p class="para-content">You have the right to:<br><br>

                    Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal 
                    data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.<br><br>

                    Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you 
                    corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.<br><br>

                    Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us 
                    continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised 
                    your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase 
                    your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific 
                    legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.<br><br>

                    Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something 
                    about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights 
                    and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, 
                    we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.<br><br>

                    Request restriction of processing your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the 
                    following scenarios:

                    <ul class="list-area">
                        <li>If you want us to establish the data's accuracy.</li>
                        <li>Where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it.</li>
                        <li>Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.</li>
                        <li>You have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</li>
                    </ul>
</p>
<p class="para-content">Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal 
    data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for 
    us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.<br><br>

    Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of 
    any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or 
    services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
